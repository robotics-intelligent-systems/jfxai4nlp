# Artificial Intelligence in Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in both spoken and written forms. It combines computational linguistics (rule-based language modeling) with machine learning and deep learning to process large volumes of text or speech data effectively. Permazen is a Language-Natural Persistence Layer for Java. DKPro Core is a collection of software components for (NLP) based on the Apache UIMA framework. The Spring AI project provides a Spring-friendly API and abstractions for developing AI applications
